# Academic Integrity and Collaboration Policy

We are serious about enforcing the class's collaboration and integrity policy.
Specifically,

* **The work that you turn in must be yours.** Code that you turn in must be code that
you wrote and debugged. Do not discuss code, in any form, with your classmates
or others outside the class (for example, discussing code on a whiteboard is not
okay). As a corollary, it's not okay to show others your code, look at anyone
else's, or help others debug. It is okay to discuss code with the instructor and
TAs. 

* **You must acknowledge your influences.** This means, first, writing down the
names of people with whom you discussed the assignment, and what you discussed
with them. If student A gets an idea from student B, both students are obligated
to write down that fact and also what the idea was. Second, you are obligated to
acknowledge other contributions (for example, ideas from Web sites or other
sources). The only exception is that material presented in class or the textbook
does not require citation. 

* **You must not look at, or use, solutions from prior years or the Web, or seek
assistance from the Internet.** For example, do not post questions from our lab
assignments on the Web. Ask the course staff, via email or Piazza, if you have
questions about this.

* **You must take reasonable steps to protect your work. You must not publish
your solutions (for example on github or stackoverflow), in this semester or any
future semester.** You are obligated to protect your files and printouts from
access. 

* **If there are inexplicable discrepancies between exam and lab performance, we
will overweight the exam, and possibly interview you.** Our exams will cover the
labs. If, in light of your exam performance, your lab performance is
implausible, we may discount or even disgard your lab grade (if this happens, we
will notify you). We may also conduct an interview or oral exam. 

* **We will enforce the policy strictly.** Penalties include failing the course,
referral to the university's disciplinary body, and possible expulsion.

## More about collaboration
You can discuss the labs in general terms with your classmates. What does
"general terms" mean? First of all, per the policy above, you cannot look at the
written work of anyone else (besides your partner for a given assignment).
Second, after discussing a problem with another student (or the course staff!),
go do something else (read a book, watch a movie) for half an hour before going
back to work on the assignment. If you can't remember what the person said after
a half hour, you didn't really understand it. 

## More about source material 
You are welcome to use existing public libraries in your programming assignments
(such as public classes for queues, trees, etc.) You may also look at code for
public domain software such as Github. Consistent with the policies and normal
academic practice, you are obligated to cite any source that gave you code or an
idea. Per the policy above, you may not look at any course material relating to
any project or lab similar to this course's assignments. You may not look at
work done by students in past years' courses. You may not look at similar course
projects at other universities. If you are unsure about whether a particular
source of external information is permitted, contact the instructor before
looking at it.

## More about academic integrity

The above guidelines are necessarily generalizations and cannot account for all
circumstances. Intellectual dishonesty can end your career, and it is your
responsibility to stay on the right side of the line. If you are not sure about
something, ask.

## Missed Exams

Missed tests cannot be made up unless there are extenuating circumstances (
death, severe illness, etc.) and the student has e-mailed the instructor before 
the test. A 0% is earned for the test if student does not adhere to the 
above policy.

Absolutely no makeup final exam will be given.
